# FIM_Code
The code notebooks in this repository can be used to create and add data to a database file as well as upload data to HydroShare to enable visualization. The DataImporter code is used for these functions, and the FindInputData tool is used for finding the HUC8s and NWM Features to be associated with each FIM source.

You can open the DataImporter code in Google Colab at the following link:
