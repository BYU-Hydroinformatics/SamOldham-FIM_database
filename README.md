# FIM_database
Files and code for populating a Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) database.

The Google Colab notebook linked below can be used to build and populate a Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) Database that follows the format made in our study. The notebook can also be used to populate an existing database with the correct format. Tools to find the HUC8 and National Water Model feature ids to connect to your model are also linked to in the notebook.
